# The 0–1 Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem.
# Each item has a value and a weight, and we must maximize total value within a given capacity.
# Unlike fractional knapsack, items cannot be divided — they are either taken (1) or not (0).
# The problem is solved using Dynamic Programming, which builds a table of subproblems representing best value for smaller capacities.
# It illustrates the concept of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
# This approach guarantees an optimal solution efficiently compared to exponential recursion.

# Algorithm
# Input n, values[], weights[], and capacity.
# Create DP table of size (n+1) × (capacity+1).
# For each item i and capacity w:
# If item fits:
# dp[i][w] = max(value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]], dp[i-1][w])
# Else:
# dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
# dp[n][capacity] gives the maximum value.
# Backtrack to find included items.
